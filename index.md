## Projects
Here you can find some projects I developed during my studies or internships or which I am
currently developing for fun.

speech to image generative NLP pipeline.

It was developed as part of my internship at Deutsche Museum Nuremberg (Zukunftsmuseum).

### Web-App
For my bachelor thesis I developed a small web app providing an online form as means to
collect human written texts that were compared to AI-generated texts.

> 🔗 [ba-web-form](https://github.com/man00ka/ba-web-form)

The app was written in python 
[flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/#python-version), 
uses some basic html and css and was deployed via [vercel](https://vercel.com/home).


The online form is available [here](https://online-formular.vercel.app).

### Software design patterns
A small fun project to try out the pygame engine and learn about software design patterns.
