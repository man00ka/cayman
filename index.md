## Projects
Here you can find some projects I developed during my studies or internships or which I am
currently developing for fun.

### TextProcessingModule
A two-tiered toxic language filter, toxic span detection and keyword extractor for a
speech to image generative NLP pipeline.

It was developed as part of my internship at **Deutsches Museum Nuremberg** (Zukunftsmuseum).

### Web-App
For my bachelor thesis I developed a small **web app** providing an online form as means to
collect human written texts that were compared to AI-generated texts.

> 🔗 [ba-web-form](https://github.com/man00ka/ba-web-form) – github

The app was written in python 
[flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/#python-version), 
uses some basic html and css and was deployed via [vercel](https://vercel.com/home).


The online form is available [here](https://online-formular.vercel.app).

### Software design patterns
A small fun project to try out the **pygame** engine and learn about **software design patterns**.

### Clickbait spoiling – SemEval23 (code snippet)
Code snippet for converting and pre-processing training and evaluation data from a 
SemEval 2023 task so the data fit the fine-tuning process of a DistilBert model for question answering
as described [here](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter7/7?fw=pt#question-answering)
